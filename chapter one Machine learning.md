### MACHINE LEARNING
Machine learning is the science of program a computer to perform a certain task. A computer learning according to the data which trained. For example, you have data set of images of cats and dog this dataset used to train the system and small portion of data used to test. The system can understand the image of cats and dogs because it understands the data which were trained.
### WHY USE MACHINE LEARNING
We use machine learning to solve the problem which face human being on daily activity. For example, Amazon is the one which deals with online business through machine help to raise the market they use different algorithm to raise the income they use such association rule and other.
Machine Learning can be learning new data by consider the historical data or trained data.
### TYPE OF MACHINE LEARNING
## Supervised   
on this data was trained to the algorithm include the target of the solution of the problem. And also known as label. The data is classified or categorical. Example of this include k-Near rest Neighbors, Liner Regression, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tre and random Forest.
## Unsupervised Learning 
the trained data is unlabeled or data is not classified or categorical. unsupervised learning algorithm include cluster, visualization and dimensionality reduction, Association rule learning
## Semi supervised
this is the combination of supervised and unsupervised
## Reinforcement learning 
this learning system learning as agent on this agent can learning environment, select and performing an action and get reward or get negative reward. if do well get reward if do bad get penalty.
## Batch learning and Online learning
Batch learning this involve train all data which are available it takes a lot of time to complete due to the use of all resource of machine such as CPU, memory space, disk space. This is called offline learning the main problem of this is not easy to adapt change.
Online learning the system is trained incremental by feeding it a data in an instant sequential by data itself or small amount of group of data.it is fast compared to Batch learning.
## Instance-based learning and Model-based learning
Instance-based learning the system learning the data by using similarity measure and the generalize to new case.
Model base learning this involve create a model and train a model and then predict. This involve us e parameter, the cost function is used to measure bad or good of the model created.
### Main challenge of machine learning 
The main challenge are bad algorithm and bad data, when use bad algorithm to train a system will produce poor output and when use bad data the output will be poor.
## Insufficient Quantity of train data
If use large data amount of data it will the result is accuracy and if use small amount of data the out put will be not accuracy.
## Nonrepresentative Training
This involve the train the system with bias data for example the data is missing on a dataset.
## Poor Quality of Data
If a data contains full of error, noise it will produce low accuracy and wrong production. In older to produce accuracy the data must be clean before train. But do this it spends a lot of time.
## Irrelevant Features
This involve train a system with feature which lead to produce wrong accuracy. In order to solve this before train model first make feature selection, feature extraction and final create new feature by gathering new data.
## Overfitting the Training data
It performs much better on the training data but does not generalize well. This occur when the model is too complex relative to the amount and noise of the data. The solution of this problem is simplifying model, reduce the noise into train data, regularization use to solve this problem by controlled by a hyperparameter. Hyperparameter is parameter of learning algorithm.
## Underfitting the Taring Data 
It occurs when model is too simpler to learn underlying structure of the data.
